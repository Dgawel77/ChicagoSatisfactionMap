made for Uncommon Hacks '22

# Description

Using the Twitter API, we've extracted tweets that talked about their neighborhood in Chicago. We then performed sentiment analysis on them using the diliBert model to measure whether they were saying positive or negative things about it. Then we used this data to create an interactive map of Chicago where users can look at the different neighborhoods and see how happy they are
