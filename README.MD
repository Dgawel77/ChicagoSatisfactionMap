Uchicago Satisfaction Map

In this project we used the Twitter API to gather tweets from different areas of Chicago and used the distilBERT model to perform sentiment analysis on them to determine whether they were positive or negative. We then used this sentiment analysis to map how happy the different neighborhoods of Chicago were based on their tweets.
